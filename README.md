# feed-alert


Problem: 
- Hard to trust whether feed hoppers are full from software. I believe they use feed distributed to calculate the status of the hopper. 
- Problem discovery happens when hoppers are checked manually, feed may have been empty for hours, reducing feed inputted to pond and slowing growth.
- No mobile alerting, must monitor desktop all day

Must: 
- Notify user when a "hopper" is empty
- Deliver notification through mobile
- Be very cheap, ideally < $30 to create with DIY components

Should:
- Notify user when feed has 1 week to empty
- Not notify user when feed is being adjusted
- Be compatible with hoppers with bottom extruders

Could:
- Track time-to-empty


Won't:
- Work offline, assume connection possible
